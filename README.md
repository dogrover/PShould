# PShould #

**PShould** (pronounced "should" or "puh-should") is a fluent assertion module for Powershell.

PShould will validate a given assumption and throw an exception if the assumption is incorrect.

PShould is part of the PSST PowerShell Suite for Testing:

* [PSMock - mocking for PowerShell](https://github.com/jonwagner/PSMock)
* [PShould - fluent assertions for PowerShell](https://github.com/jonwagner/PShould)
